                A gold coin is a coin that is made mostly or entirely of gold. Most gold coins minted since 1800 are
                90–92% gold (22 karat), while most of today's gold bullion coins are pure gold, such as the Krugerrand,
                Canadian Maple Leaf, and Australian Kangaroo.<br> Alloyed gold coins, like the American Gold Eagle and
                South
                African Krugerrand, are typically 91.7% gold by weight, with the remainder being silver and copper.
                Traditionally (up to about the 1930s), gold coins have been circulation coins, including coin-like
                bracteates and dinars. In recent decades, however, gold coins are mainly produced as bullion coins for
                investors and as commemorative coins for collectors.<br> While modern gold coins are still legal tender,
                they are not observed in everyday financial transactions, as the metal value normally exceeds the
                nominal value. For example, the American Gold Eagle has a denomination of 10 USD, but a metal value of
                more than $800 USD (being around a half an ounce).
                The gold reserves of central banks are dominated by gold bars, but gold coins may occasionally
                contribute.
            <div class="intro__indentation">
                Gold has been used as money for many reasons. It is fungible, with a low spread between the prices to
                buy and sell.<br> Gold is also easily transportable, as it has a high value-to-weight ratio compared to
                other commodities such as silver. Gold can be re-coined, divided into smaller units, or melted into
                larger units such as gold bars, without destroying its metal value. The density of gold is higher than
                most other metals, making it difficult to pass counterfeits. Additionally, gold is extremely unreactive
                chemically: it does not tarnish or corrode over time.</div>

            <h1 class="section__header">Short history of gold</h1>
            <p>
                The history of gold is long connected with money, but gold relinquished this role in developed economies
                after the outbreak of the Second World War. At the end of the war, the <i>Bretton Woods</i> monetary
                system, a
                regime of fixed exchange rates, was created. This system broke down in 1971 when the US unilaterally
                ended its gold standard, which set the convertibility of gold and the dollar to US$35 per ounce.
                References to the Gold Standard often refer to two key periods in history: that of the Classical Gold
                Standard and that of the post Bretton Woods gold-pegged exchange rate system.

            <h1 class="section__header">Most popular golden coins</h1>
            <h2 class="section__coinName">Krugerrand</h2>
            When you think of South African gold, it is likely you that the world famous Krugerrand and Rand coins will
            spring to mind. Many people buy Krugerrand coins as an investment in physical gold. This gold coin has a
            long history and was once the world's best-selling investment currency and became especially popular in
            America. The success of this coin has also encouraged other countries to mint their very own gold coins,
            such as the Maple Leaf, which was first issued in Canada in 1979.
            First Krugerrand was minted in 1967. It was the <strong>first</strong> coin to be minted in exactly 1 troy
            ounce of gold, which is now the standard weight for gold trading.<div class="section__coinName--identation">
            Today, this coin is still minted by the Rand Refinery in South Africa and the Krugerrand remains one of
            the best known investment coins. The obverse of this gold coin depicts Paul Kruger, the fifth president
            of South Africa. On the reverse of the coin is a springbok, an animal that symbolizes the African
            wilderness. Due to an alloy of gold and copper, this coin has a recognizable red-gold color. In
            addition, the Krugerrand has a purity of 22 carats (916.7 / 1000).</div>
            <h2 class="section__coinName">Vienna Philharmonic</h2>
            The 1 Troy ounce gold Vienna Philharmonic coin is issued by the Austrian Mint and minted in the highest
            purity of 24 carat (99.99% pure) gold. Between 1989 and 2001, the coin's nominal value was expressed in
            schillings. In 2001, after the introduction of the Euro this was changed accordingly, making it the first
            gold coin to be minted in the Euro currency.
            The Vienna Philharmonic coin has remained one of the world's most popular investment coins since its
            introduction in 1989. Vienna's world famous philharmonic orchestra was the inspiration for the coin's design
            and has remained the same since its issue.
            <h2 class="section__coinName">Marple Leaf</h2>
            The 1 Oz Maple Leaf 2022 gold coin series remains immensely popular all over the world. It is recognized as
            Canada's official gold investment coin and is the first bullion coin to be produced with 99.99% (24 carat)
            purity. To this day gold Maple Leaf coins are still produced with the same high purity and recognisable
            design. The coin is also considered legal tender throughout Canada.
            Maple Leaf gold coins are issued in a standard size of 1 Troy Ounce.<br> As well as this, the coin is also
            produced in smaller sizes of 1/2, 1/4, 1/10 and 1/20 Troy ounce editions. Its design features the maple leaf
            after which the coin is named after as well as being recognized as Canada's national emblem. The obverse of
            the coin holds the official portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and includes details of the coin's nominal value
            (50 dollars) and the year of issue. Maple Leaf coins are well-known throughout the world and therefore
            traded all around the world.
            <h2 class="section__coinName">Australian Kangaroo</h2>
            The 1 Oz Kangaroo 2022 is a coin minted in gold with a 999.9 purity and a spectacular Australian design.
            This coin series has remained a popular among both gold investors as well as coin collectors since it
            launched in 1986.
            Originally, this coin was called the Australian Nugget because its design featured the largest gold nugget
            ever found in Australia.<br>However, after 1989, this changed to a design of a kangaroo. This design is updated
            annually and is therefore also popular gold coin for collectors. For the year 2022 we see a detailed
            illustration a kangaroo with its joey in the Australian wilderness. The other side of Australian Kangaroo
            coin remains unchanged and features the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.
            <h2 class="section__coinName">American Eagle</h2>
            The American Eagle is known as the first gold American coin to be produced for trading purposes. The coin
            came to market in 1986 by the United States Mint. The gold American Eagle is minted in a 916.7 purity, which
            is also known as 22 carat gold. This coin is minted exclusively from gold derived from American soil as
            stated in the 1985 Gold Bullion Act. The coin is adorned with American symbolism: the obverse shows “Walking
            Liberty,” goddess of freedom. In her right hand she holds a flaming torch. In her left she clutches an olive
            branch. The flipside is reserved for the eagle that has given its name to this gold coin
